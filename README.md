# Pico Universal Flash Nuke

Tired of hunting for the right flash_nuke.uf2 for your RP2040 or RP2350 based board? Your Pico, your Pico W, your Pico 2 W, no, I'm not keyword stuffing... you are!

That nightmare is over. My gift to you: Pico Universal Flash Nuke!

* The only .uf2 you'll ever need for all your nuking purposes!
* Detects the size of a Pico or RP2XXX board's attached flash and nukes it accordingly.
* *should* work with both RP2040 and RP2350 using a single, handy .uf2.

(This incredibly delicately combined uf2 was created using the awesome power of `cat`)
