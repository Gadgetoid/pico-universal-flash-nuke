# Pico Universal Flash Nuke

Detect the size of a Pico or RP2XXX board's attached flash and nuke it accordingly.

I got tired of having to find/build the correct nuke for any given board!

This incredibly delicately combined uf2 using the awesome power of `cat` *should* work with both RP2040 and RP2350.
